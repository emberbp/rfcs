# Ember.js Budapest Meetup Group RFCs

This repo is for various discussions that involve more than a few tweets or Slack channel messages. The primary use-case is to plan projects that are to be implemented by the meetup members during our workshop sessions. If you have good idea about what sort of application you would want to develop with your fellow members as an excersize, feel free to submit an RFC or comment on an existing one!

## Contributing

* Fork the RFC repo http://github.com/emberjs/rfcs
* Copy 0000-template.md to active/0000-my-feature.md (where 'my-feature' is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).
* Fill in the RFC
* Submit a pull request. The pull request is the time to get review of the design from the core team and the community.
* Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments.
